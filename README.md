<h2> Simple Calculator with Javafx </h2>

It is a simple calculator. The GUI is created using Javafx. It allows the users to enter numbers and operation through clicking the buttons, and then calculates the results. The multiplication and division are calculated first, and the subtraction and addition are calculated afterwards. Additonal functionalities include: backspace, that removes the last character on the display; the 'C' button, that cleans the screen.

<h2> Basic algorithm </h2>

The numbers and operators entered comprise a 'query', once the user clicks on the '=' button, the query is passed to the class for calculation, which parses the query and returns the result as a string.

<h2> How to make it work</h2>

This is a maven project, so you can go to the project folder and executs the following commands in the CMD:

    "mvn clean compile javafx:run".
